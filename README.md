# AirBnB clone

The Airbnb clone project replicates a mini-version of the Airbnb website for learning purposes.
It includes:
- A command interpreter to manipulate data without a visual interface, like in a Shell (perfect for development and debugging)
- A website (the front-end) that shows the final product to everybody: static and dynamic
- A database or files that store data (data = objects)
- An API that provides a communication interface between the front-end and your data (retrieve, create, delete, update them)

## 1 - The console
The console is a command interpreter that enables developers to manage objects in the project from a command-line interface. With it you can:
- Create a new object (ex: a new User or a new Place)
- Retrieve an object from a file, a database etc…
- Do operations on objects (count, compute stats, etc…)
- Update attributes of an object
- Destroy an object
